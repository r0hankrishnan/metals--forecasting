# metals-forecasting
This is a recreation of my work for BUSQOM 1080. In this class, we conducted a full analytics consulting engagement with a mid-sized local manufacturer. As technology lead, I used R to develop several forecasting models to predict the LME spot price of a metal. 

I will be recreating this project from scratch (including data collection) with a different metal price. I will also be making an equivalent implementation in python.
